# Greater Vancouver Traffic Simulator

A data-grounded, visually rich traffic simulator for Metro Vancouver — real street network, transit, and commute data driving **Eclipse SUMO**, rendered as smooth 2D animation in the browser with zoom from regional overview to individual intersections.

> **Status:** Phase 0 (research + environment setup). Not yet runnable end-to-end — see `CURRENT_STATE.md`.

## What it does (target)

- Imports the real OSM street network (including bridges), TransLink transit, and Statistics Canada commute flows for Metro Vancouver.
- Simulates a full day of traffic in SUMO, with realistic AM/PM peaks, midday traffic, and commercial/industrial deliveries.
- Replays the simulation in a browser: land-use zones, roads and bridges, transit lines, and animated vehicles distinguished by type (car, carpool, bus, delivery van, heavy truck, SkyTrain).
- Lets you inject accidents and road closures and watch the impact ripple through the network (before/after comparison).

## Architecture (batch-then-replay)

```
ETL (Python)  ─►  SUMO run (libsumo + TraCI)  ─►  FastAPI  ─►  Browser (deck.gl + MapLibre)
OSM/GTFS/         one simulated day, sampled        Arrow/        zones · roads · transit ·
census/zoning     geo FCD → Parquet trajectories    GeoJSON       vehicles by type · day-scrubber
   │                                                  PMTiles
   └─► SQLite (network meta, OD, zones, scenarios, calibration)
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Prerequisites: Python 3.11+ with uv (SUMO 1.27 arrives as a wheel via uv sync)
uv sync                                        # install Python + SUMO deps

# 1. Build the data pipeline for the downtown peninsula (OSM net, transit,
#    census OD, zoning, signals, closure scenarios, calibration targets)
uv run python -m etl all                       # or a single step, e.g. `etl network`
uv run python -m etl calibrate                 # seed bridge count targets

# 2. Run a calibrated census-driven AM peak (baseline) and a closure scenario
uv run python -m sim run --demand census --name am_base --scale 0.18 \
      --begin 25200 --end 32400
uv run python -m sim run --demand census --name am_granville --scale 0.18 \
      --begin 25200 --end 32400 --scenario close_granville_bridge

# 3. Check calibration (simulated bridge volumes vs published counts, GEH)
uv run python -m sim calibrate --run am_base   # -> docs/calibration/report.md

# 4. Serve and view in the browser
uv run uvicorn api.main:app                    # http://127.0.0.1:8000
# open http://127.0.0.1:8000/  (add ?run=<id> to load a specific run)

# Metro-wide (Phase 7): a mesoscopic Greater Vancouver run
uv run python -m etl network --area metro      # major-road regional net
uv run python -m sim run --demand metro --name metro_am --scale 0.15 \
      --begin 25200 --end 32400                # ~27k vehicles, mesoscopic
# select the metro run in the viewer (it switches to a regional flow view)
```

All six build phases (0–6) are complete (the calibrated peninsula vertical slice
runs end to end); Phase 7 adds a mesoscopic metro-wide region. See
`docs/development/` for phase plans and the change log.
